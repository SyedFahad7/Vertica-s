# ShowFinder

ShowFinder is a modern web application for discovering and exploring TV shows. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, it leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to provide detailed information about trending shows, top-rated series, airing schedules, and in-depth details such as seasons, episodes, ratings, and more. The app features a responsive interface styled with Tailwind CSS and fluid animations powered by Framer Motion and Lucide icons fileciteturn0file15.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

ShowFinder is designed to help users browse and search for TV shows, offering an engaging user interface for both casual viewers and TV enthusiasts. The project uses cutting-edge web technologies such as:
  
- **React with TypeScript** for component-based architecture and type safety.
- **Vite** for fast development builds and hot module replacement.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive designs.
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations.
- **Lucide-react** icons for crisp and scalable vector icons.

This repository includes all source code to support searching, filtering, and displaying detailed information of TV shows. The user interface seamlessly connects to TMDB, fetching data and presenting it in a visually appealing manner fileciteturn0file7.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Usage

ShowFinder is bundled with a set of scripts to facilitate local development and production builds. The available scripts include:

- **Development Mode:**  
  Run the app locally with hot-reloading using:  
  `npm run dev`  
  or  
  `yarn dev`

- **Build:**  
  Create an optimized production build with:  
  `npm run build`  
  or  
  `yarn build`

- **Preview:**  
  Preview a production build locally:  
  `npm run preview`  
  or  
  `yarn preview`

- **Linting:**  
  Validate code quality using ESLint (configured for TypeScript and React):  
  `npm run lint`  
  or  
  `yarn lint`

These commands are defined in the package.json file and are supported by Vite’s fast development environment fileciteturn0file13.

## Configuration

To configure the application, ensure that you provide the required TMDB API key as an environment variable. The application expects an API key to be set under the variable `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY`.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository.
2. Add the following line:
   ```
   VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```
3. Restart the development server for the changes to take effect.

This variable is used throughout the code to make authenticated requests to the TMDB API (for example, see the fetch calls in the Home and Search pages fileciteturn0file0).
